     * ---
     *
     * Create a configuration that defines how data is processed and synced to iModels in the specific iTwin.
     *
     * ### Configurations
     *
     * #### clampZExtent
     *
     * Enables a limit for the project Z extent maximum up to Mount Everest height (i.e.8849 meters). Works only when project extent in XY direction is defined for iModel.
     * The default value is false.
     *
     * Display performance can be adversely affected if source data is poorly aligned or contains elements far from the project's physical location. If files cannot be corrected, this configuration would help viewers to restrict the Z extent.
     *
     * Use case example: allows restricting viewport to the bounding box so that any arbitrary geometry far away from the actual design does not impact fitting the model to the viewport.
     *
     * #### convertDgnTerrainModels
     *
     * Enables terrain model elements to be processed during dgn-based synchronizations.
     * The default value is false.
     *
     * #### squashIntermediateRevisions
     *
     * Enables the creation of a single Changeset for physical and drawing elements (2D, 3D) coming from all Source Files. Separate Changesets will be pushed for any schema or definition changes.
     * The default value is false.
     *
     * Use case example: minimize a linear timeline of the iModel changes. However, in this case, you would not be able to get information on individual Source File changes.
     *
     * #### convertDgnHyperModelingSections
     *
     * Enables displaying the 2D section graphics and annotations in the context of the 3D model.
     * The default value is true.
     *
     * Use case example: typical design files include hypermodels, and the intent is to expose such information in a viewer. Refer to the sample of how to navigate between the 2D and 3D views easily: [sample](https://www.itwinjs.org/sandboxes/iTwinPlatform/Hyper-modeling)
     *
     * #### skipRvtReprojection
     *
     * Ignores geo-location defined in .rvt file and overlaps the model at the local iModel coordinates.
     * The default value is false.
     *
     * This configuration will have no effect if Revit was the first file synchronized to an empty iModel.
     *
     * Use case example: multiple Revit files will need to be synchronized; if individual files are not aligned to the exact location, this configuration will bring all the models to the same place. However, we suggest enhancing the original design files with proper geographic coordinate systems before synchronization instead of using this configuration.

     *
     * #### overrideRvtReprojectionDistance
     *
     * Define distance in meters when to start ignoring .rvt file geo-location data and reprojecting graphics based on local iModel coordinates.
     * The default value is 0.
     *
     * Reprojection happens when the .rvt file and iModel have different geographic coordinate systems. If the distance between both GCS is bigger than the number provided with the flag, reprojection will be skipped, and no errors will be reported. Otherwise, reprojection will be applied.
     * This configuration will have no effect if Revit was the first file synchronized to an empty iModel.
     *
     * Use case example: no reprojection of Revit file is needed beyond some pre-defined radius.
     *
     * #### enableFileNamePolicy
     *
     * Sets the active file policy to use file names instead of GUIDs when running the connector. It is only applicable to file-based synchronization workflows.
     * The default value is false.
     *
     * If a mismatch occurs between the active file policy and the stored file policy inside the iModel, the connector job run will fail.
     *
     * Use case example: in a particular document management system, the uniqueness of files is determined by file name, while the GUID value could change; setting this configuration to true would allow synchronization jobs to recognize individual files and avoid duplicates.

     *
     * - Every Generic element in the model will be re-processed, so expect a longer synchronization job.
     * - Elements that are derived from a BIS class will not be processed.
     * - Elements that did not change in the source file may appear modified in iModel if you use the Changed Elements API.
     * - Elements that changed will appear deleted and added in iModel if you use the Changed Elements API.
     * - Suggest setting this configuration with caution and per required run basis, not perpetual.
     *
     * Use case example: If you have been advised by Bentley support that the Connector has added additional support for your files' disciplines (e.g. additional BIS schema alignment), then this option should be enabled on the next run to opt-in to the updated alignment.
     *
     * #### ignoreDgnAttachments
     *
     * Enables skipping of all reference attachments. As a result, only the master file is synchronized into the iModel. Only applicable for .dgn and .dwg files.
     * The default value is false.
     *
     * A reference file could have a transform/ level override/ symbology override when attached through a master file. None of these settings will be available if the files are processed individually and could result in data not matching the intended design.
     *
     * #### enableSheetsAndDrawings
     *
     * Controls sheets and drawings synchronization. If enabled all sheet models and relayed drawings will be synchronized to an iModel.
     * The default value is false.

  /**
   * ---
   *
   * Create a configuration that defines how data is processed and synced to iModels in the specific iTwin.
   *
   * ### Configurations
   *
   * #### clampZExtent
   *
   * Enables a limit for the project Z extent maximum up to Mount Everest height (i.e.8849 meters). Works only when project extent in XY direction is defined for iModel.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * Display performance can be adversely affected if source data is poorly aligned or contains elements far from the project's physical location. If files cannot be corrected, this configuration would help viewers to restrict the Z extent.
   *
   * Use case example: allows restricting viewport to the bounding box so that any arbitrary geometry far away from the actual design does not impact fitting the model to the viewport.
   *
   * #### convertDgnTerrainModels
   *
   * Enables terrain model elements to be processed during dgn-based synchronizations.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * #### squashIntermediateRevisions
   *
   * Enables the creation of a single Changeset for physical and drawing elements (2D, 3D) coming from all Source Files. Separate Changesets will be pushed for any schema or definition changes.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * Use case example: minimize a linear timeline of the iModel changes. However, in this case, you would not be able to get information on individual Source File changes.
   *
   * #### convertDgnHyperModelingSections
   *
   * Enables displaying the 2D section graphics and annotations in the context of the 3D model.
   * The default value is true.
   *
   * Use case example: typical design files include hypermodels, and the intent is to expose such information in a viewer. Refer to the sample of how to navigate between the 2D and 3D views easily: [sample](https://www.itwinjs.org/sandboxes/iTwinPlatform/Hyper-modeling)
   *
   * #### skipRvtReprojection
   *
   * Ignores geo-location defined in .rvt file and overlaps the model at the local iModel coordinates.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * This configuration will have no effect if Revit was the first file synchronized to an empty iModel.
   *
   * Use case example: multiple Revit files will need to be synchronized; if individual files are not aligned to the exact location, this configuration will bring all the models to the same place. However, we suggest enhancing the original design files with proper geographic coordinate systems before synchronization instead of using this configuration.

  /**
   * ---
   *
   * Create a configuration that defines how data is processed and synced to iModels in the specific iModel.
   *
   * ### Configurations
   *
   * #### clampZExtent
   *
   * Enables a limit for the project Z extent maximum up to Mount Everest height (i.e.8849 meters). Works only when project extent in XY direction is defined for iModel.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * Display performance can be adversely affected if source data is poorly aligned or contains elements far from the project's physical location. If files cannot be corrected, this configuration would help viewers to restrict the Z extent.
   *
   * Use case example: allows restricting viewport to the bounding box so that any arbitrary geometry far away from the actual design does not impact fitting the model to the viewport.
   *
   * #### overrideRvtReprojectionDistance
   *
   * Define distance in meters when to start ignoring .rvt file geo-location data and reprojecting graphics based on local iModel coordinates.
   * The default value is 0.
   *
   * Reprojection happens when the .rvt file and iModel have different geographic coordinate systems. If the distance between both GCS is bigger than the number provided with the flag, reprojection will be skipped, and no errors will be reported. Otherwise, reprojection will be applied.
   * This configuration will have no effect if Revit was the first file synchronized to an empty iModel.
   *
   * Use case example: no reprojection of Revit file is needed beyond some pre-defined radius.
   *
   * #### enableFileNamePolicy
   *
   * Sets the active file policy to use file names instead of GUIDs when running the connector. It is only applicable to file-based synchronization workflows.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * If a mismatch occurs between the active file policy and the stored file policy inside the iModel, the connector job run will fail.
   *
   * Use case example: in a particular document management system, the uniqueness of files is determined by file name, while the GUID value could change; setting this configuration to true would allow synchronization jobs to recognize individual files and avoid duplicates.
   *
   * ### Authentication
   *
   * Requires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `synchronization:modify`.
   *

   *
   * Create a configuration that defines how data is processed and synced to iModels with the specific connection.
   *
   * ### Configurations
   *
   * #### reclassifyDgnElements
   *
   * Enables connector to change the base class of an element if its current classification comes from the Generic schema.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * If this configuration is set to true:
   *
   * - Every Generic element in the model will be re-processed, so expect a longer synchronization job.
   * - Elements that are derived from a BIS class will not be processed.
   * - Elements that did not change in the source file may appear modified in iModel if you use the Changed Elements API.
   * - Elements that changed will appear deleted and added in iModel if you use the Changed Elements API.
   * - Suggest setting this configuration with caution and per required run basis, not perpetual.
   *
   * Use case example: If you have been advised by Bentley support that the Connector has added additional support for your files' disciplines (e.g. additional BIS schema alignment), then this option should be enabled on the next run to opt-in to the updated alignment.
   *
   * #### ignoreDgnAttachments
   *
   * Enables skipping of all reference attachments. As a result, only the master file is synchronized into the iModel. Only applicable for .dgn and .dwg files.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * A reference file could have a transform/ level override/ symbology override when attached through a master file. None of these settings will be available if the files are processed individually and could result in data not matching the intended design.
   *
   * #### enableSheetsAndDrawings
   *
   * Controls sheets and drawings synchronization. If enabled all sheet models and relayed drawings will be synchronized to an iModel.
   * The default value is false.
   *
   * ### Authentication
   *
   * Requires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `synchronization:modify`.
   *
   * For more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.

   *
   * The `Prefer` header can be used to specify how much result metadata is desired by the client. The `Prefer` request header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are preferred by the client but are not required for successful completion of the request.
   *
   * This operation supports `"return=representation"` and `"return=minimal"` preferences.
   *
   * The `"return=representation"` preference indicates that the client prefers that the server include an entity representing the current state of the resource in the response to a successful request.
   * The `"return=minimal"` preference indicates that the client wishes the server to return only a minimal response to a successful request. This is the default preference if `Prefer` header is not specified.

   * ### Notes
   *
   * The `Prefer` header can be used to specify how much result metadata is desired by the client. The `Prefer` request header field is used to indicate that particular server behaviors are preferred by the client but are not required for successful completion of the request.
   *
   * This operation supports `"return=representation"` and `"return=minimal"` preferences.
   *
   * The `"return=representation"` preference indicates that the client prefers that the server include an entity representing the current state of the resource in the response to a successful request.
   * The `"return=minimal"` preference indicates that the client wishes the server to return only a minimal response to a successful request. This is the default preference if `Prefer` header is not specified.
   *
   * ### Authentication
   *
   * Requires `Authorization` header with valid Bearer token for scope `synchronization:read`.
   *
   * For more documentation on authorization and how to get access token visit [OAUTH2 Authorization](https://developer.bentley.com/apis/overview/authorization/) page.
